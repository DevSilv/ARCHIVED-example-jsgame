# silvuss-example-jsgame project

This repository contains my third GitHub project – just a simple example browser arcade game, written mostly in JavaScript.

**Read before use:** This game **is not** intended to be used according to the purpose described above. You may use it **only** to test whether the code is written the way it is expected to be (i.e. it produces expected results) and **only** when you know what the code will really do. For details, see the section "[Disclaimers](#disclaimers)" of this README.

## Copyright note

Note that this "silvuss-example-jsgame" project (this repository) has currently **no license**, as explained in [this GitHub guide on licensing projects](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:

> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## Disclaimers

**This game is an example game that is not intended to be run.** Its purpose is only to show code that is known to work. While probably nothing dangerous would happen, you may run it only under your own responsibility.

Although I have made efforts to make it work as intended and described, it is not a "proffessional" game. Specifically, it was not tested in terms of separate unit tests or similar. It was tested to build and work on only one platform. For details on the platform, see the section "[Environment, tools and technologies used](#environment-tools-and-technologies-used)" of this README.

**I have created this game mainly to learn javascript, so I suppose it is not, and is not supposed to be, "a real game"; both it is easy and does not use DirectX nor OpenGL (not yet).**

## How to install and run this game?

One may play the game (or just see how the website looks and works) by opening the `index.html` file in their browser. If they do not want to download the sources from GitHub, **currently** the game is published on GitHub Pages and available under [this link](FIXME).

## What are the rules and the goal of this game (in general)?

The goal of this game is to "click out" (currently, only clicking, not touching) all the objects moving over the board. When one click on the moving objects, they disappear. When they "click out" all of them, they win.
