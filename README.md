note that "silvuss-jsgame-1" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

for your convenience i am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

also note that i can **add a lincese** in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## installation and usage
you can play the game (or just see how the site looks and works) simply by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. if you do not want to download the sources from github, **currently** the game is published on github pages and available under the following link: https://silvuss.github.io/silvuss-jsgame-1/

## the game goal and rules
the goal of this game is to "click out" (**currently** only with mouse) all the objects moving over the board.

you can read detailed information (e.g. how the game works and about the parameters) in the [game github's wiki](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-jsgame-1/wiki/home-%E2%80%93-silvuss-jsgame-1-wiki).

## the technologies used
**currently** the following technologies are used in this project:
* html 5
* css 3
* javascript – ecmascript version: 6, and maybe some features from the later versions.

## will this readme be updated?
if anything will change, i will **try to remember** to update this readme; otherwise it is not for sure.
