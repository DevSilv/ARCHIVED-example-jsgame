## Copyright note

Note that this "silvuss thoughts" project (this repository) has currently **no license**, as explained in [this GitHub guide on licensing projects](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## How to run this game?

You can play the game (or just see how the website looks and works) simply by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. If you do not want to download the sources from GitHub, **currently** the game is published on GitHub Pages and available under [this link](TODO).

## The game goal and rules

The goal of this game is to "click out" (currently, only with the mouse, not touch) all the objects moving over the board.

You can read detailed information (e.g. how the game works and about the parameters) in the [game's wiki](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-jsgame-1/wiki/home-%E2%80%93-silvuss-jsgame-1-wiki).
