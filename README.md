## Copyright note

Note that "silvuss-example-jsgame" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## How to run this game?

You can play the game (or just see how the website looks and works) simply by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. If you do not want to download the sources from GitHub, **currently** the game is published on GitHub Pages and available under the following link: https://silvuss.github.io/silvuss-jsgame-1/

## The game goal and rules

The goal of this game is to "click out" (**currently** only with the mouse, not touch) all the objects moving over the board.

You can read detailed information (e.g. how the game works and about the parameters) in the [game's wiki](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-jsgame-1/wiki/home-%E2%80%93-silvuss-jsgame-1-wiki).

## Tools and technologies used

1. HTML 5
2. CSS 3
3. JavaScript – ECMAScript version: 6, and maybe some features from later versions.

## Will this project be updated?

This project was going to show what I have learned in JavaScript by the time that it was published, so it is not supposed to be updated.
